Start the program.

Declare and initialize the variable factorial to 1 (initial factorial value).

Declare and initialize the variable i to 1 (initial loop counter).

Declare the variable number to store the input number.

Prompt the user to enter a number.

Read and store the input number in the variable number.

Enter a while loop with the condition i <= number.

Within the loop:
a. Multiply factorial by i and assign the result back to factorial.
b. Increment the value of i by 1.

After the loop ends, print the calculated factorial value.

End the program.
